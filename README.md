# Cellular Automata and Conway's "Game of Life"

Welcome to John Conway's "Game of Life"! This is a computer science
classic from 1970, a program that simulates a _cellular automaton_
(plural _automata_). It has connections to all kinds of different
aspects of computer science and nature.

## Objectives

Rules to Conways Game of Life
A) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
B) Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell. C) All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Cellular Automata: Otherwise known as CA. Also called cellular spaces, tessellation automata, homoegeneous structures, cellular structures, tessellation structures, and iterative arrays. CA has found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling. A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells. Each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created according to some fixed rule. Usually a mathematical function. Which determines teh new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neightborhood. Source (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)

Turing Completeness: A system of data-manipulation rules such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language or a cellular automaton. Which means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule set.

## Building Your App

npm javascript reactjs css love

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

## npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

## npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
